### Hi! So I created a web app in vanilla javascript that fetches data from the github api and displays it in a dashboard. The images respond to click by giving some information about the framework. There are buttons that will order the frameworks based on their amount of watchers, forks and issues. Finally there is a recommendation button that will give a recommendation based on a ranking algorithm that assigns a point value to on each framework's ranking respective to the other frameworks compared on each given attribute.
